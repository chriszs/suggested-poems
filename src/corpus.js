As day doth night.
Filling, as they advanced, with noise and shout,
With no sounding name or title,
A thousand years this land;
Every moment--and again!
Because wee freely love, as in our will
Galwegians, wild as ocean's gale,
An' love her, her only, to th' end o' my life,
Summer gave us sweets, but autumn wrought division?
Did you not touch Mercy's shore,
Love made them not; with acture they may be,
Yet live in hatred, enmitie, and strife

No longer now from shore to shore to roam,

Yet he loved, and the pale mountain-monarch's fair child

You were sorry for me in my pain,
None could Astolpho have found any where

Straightway answered and said the good and intelligent mother:
Strangest thing I've ever known,--
Wilt thou as fond and faithful be?
The feet sustained by track of feet pursued
This is another day; and its young strength

Urging its arduous matter to the close,
